## The Human Behind the Terminal

Hey there! I'm **Vilian Gerdzhikov**, but you probably know me as **Fractal-Tess** on the internet. 🎮

### What I Do All Day

By day, I'm a Telecommunications student at **Technical University of Sofia** and also have a full-stack job role at CarrierX.


### Free Time Adventures

When I'm not buried in textbooks or writing code that actually works, you can probably find me:

- 🏴‍☠️ **CTF Hunting**: Recently got into capture-the-flag competitions - now spending weekends hunting flags instead of sleeping
- 🚀 **Tech Exploration**: Discovering new frameworks and convincing myself they're "absolutely essential for work"
- 💻 **Open Source Shenanigans**: Contributing to projects (and occasionally introducing bugs that other people get to fix)
- 🎮 **Gaming**: Taking breaks from breaking code by breaking games instead

### Why This Blog Exists

Let's be honest - I highly doubt anyone would actually read this, and that's not really the goal. This ~~failed project~~ blog exists mostly for me to take a step back and look at things (or at least try to) objectively. Writing these conclusions is primarily for myself and myself only.

This has been a recent activity, but I've found it helps me be more reasonable about things and allows me to actually think instead of always being in 'blitz' mode. Consider it my personal therapy session where I try to make sense of whatever I've managed to break or accidentally fix.

If you somehow stumbled here and find my public therapy sessions entertaining - well, that's just a bonus!

*P.S. If you see me staring at a terminal for hours, don't worry - that's just my normal state. The real concern is when I'm smiling.* 😄
